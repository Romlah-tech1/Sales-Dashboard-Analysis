# Sales-Dashboard-Analysis
Microsoft Sales Data Analysis Dashboard
In this project, I developed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI, Excel, and DAX to support strategic business decision-making.

## Project Overview
I cleaned and prepared the sales data in Excel, then designed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to uncover key sales and profitability trends across time, products, segments, and regions. Using advanced DAX measures, I performed time-based analysis, customer segmentation, and category performance evaluations.

### Key Insights
Sales Trend Analysis: Identified high and low-performing months, recommending targeted marketing strategies to boost sales during low-peak periods while maintaining momentum during peak months.

Product Category Performance: Highlighted top-performing categories (Technology, Furniture, Office Supplies) to inform inventory planning and promotional focus.

Customer Segmentation: Isolated the top 10 customers driving revenue, enabling relationship-building and customer loyalty strategies.

Geographical & Temporal Sales Review: Analyzed location-based and time-based sales patterns to recommend best practices for sales growth and operational improvements.

Profitability Analysis: Provided a comprehensive view of profit, discount, and quantity sold, supporting smarter discounting and pricing strategies.
